Internet privacy has become a major concern over the past few years. Users are
becoming more aware that their online activity leaves a vast digital footprint,
that communications are not always properly secured, and that their location and
actions can be easily tracked. One of the main factors for the location tracking
issue is the wide use of long-lasting identifiers, such as MAC addresses.
      </t>

      <t>
There have been several initiatives at the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards
committees to overcome some of these privacy issues. This document provides an
overview of these activities, with the intention to inform the technical
community about them, and help coordinate between present and future
standardization activities.

    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
Internet privacy is becoming a huge concern, as more and more mobile devices are
getting directly (e.g., via Wi-Fi) or indirectly (e.g., via a
smartphone using Bluetooth) connected to the Internet. This ubiquitous
connectivity, together with not very secure protocol stacks and the lack of
proper education about privacy make it very easy to track/monitor the location
of users and/or eavesdrop their physical and online activities. This is due to
many factors, such as the vast digital footprint that users leave on the
Internet, for instance sharing information on social networks, cookies used by
browsers and servers to provide a better navigation experience, connectivity
logs that allow tracking of a user's Layer-2 (L2/MAC) or Layer-3 (L3) address,
web trackers, etc.; and/or the weak (or even null in some cases) authentication
and encryption mechanisms used to secure communications.
      </t>

      <t>
This privacy concern affects all layers of the protocol stack, from the lower
layers involved in the actual access to the network (e.g., the MAC/Layer-2 and
Layer-3 addresses can be used to obtain the location of a user) to higher layer
protocol identifiers and user applications <xref target="wifi_internet_privacy"
/>. In particular, IEEE 802 MAC addresses have historically been an easy target
for tracking users <xref target="wifi_tracking" />.

      </t>

      <t>
There have been several initiatives at the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards
committees to overcome some of these privacy issues. This document provides an
overview of these activities, with the intention to inform the community and
help coordinate between present and futures standardization activities.

Most mobile devices used today are Wi-Fi enabled (i.e. they are equipped with an
IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network interface). Wi-Fi interfaces, as any
other kind of IEEE 802-based network interface, like Ethernet (i.e. IEEE 802.3)
have a Layer-2 address also referred to as MAC address, which can be seen by
anybody who can receive the signal transmitted by the network interface. The
format of these addresses is shown in <xref target="fig:ieee802_mac_address_format" />.

        <t>
MAC addresses can either be universally administered or locally administered.
Universally administered and locally administered addresses are distinguished by
setting the second-least-significant bit of the most significant byte of the
address (the U/L bit).
        </t>

        <t>
A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its
manufacturer. Most physical devices are provided with a universally administered
address, which is composed of two parts: (i) the Organizationally Unique
Identifier (OUI), which are the first three octets in transmission order and
identify the organization that issued the identifier, and (ii) Network Interface
Controller (NIC) Specific, which are the following three octets, assigned by the
organization that manufactured the NIC, in such a way that the resulting MAC
address is globally unique.
        </t>

        <t>
Locally administered addresses override the burned-in address, and they can
either be set-up by the network administrator, or by the Operating System (OS)
of the device to which the address pertains. However, as explained in further
sections of this document, there are new initiatives at the IEEE 802 and other
organizations to specify ways in which these locally administered addresses
should be assigned, depending on the use case.
        </t>

    </section>
<!-- END Problem statement -->

<!-- BEGIN MAC address randomization -->
    <section anchor="sec:mac_addr_random" title="MAC address randomization">

      <t>
Since universally administered MAC addresses are by definition globally-unique,
when a device uses this MAC address to transmit data -especially over the air-
it is relatively easy to track this device by simple medium observation. Since a
device is usually directly associated to an individual, this poses a privacy
concern <xref target="link_layer_privacy"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
MAC addresses can be easily observed by a third party, such as a passive device
listening to communications in the same network. In an 802.11 network, a station
exposes its MAC address in two different situations:
      </t>

<t><list style="symbols">
      <t>
While actively scanning for available networks, the MAC address is used in the
Probe Request frames sent by the device (aka IEEE 802.11 STA).
      </t>

      <t>
Once associated to a given Access Point (AP), the MAC address is used in frame
transmission and reception, as one of the addresses used in the address fields
of an IEEE 802.11 frame.
      </t>
</list></t>

      <t>
One way to overcome this privacy concern is by using randomly generated MAC
addresses. As described in the previous section, the IEEE 802 addressing
includes one bit to specify if the hardware address is locally or globally
administered. This allows generating local addresses without the need of any
global coordination mechanism to ensure that the generated address is still
unique within the local network. This feature can be used to generate random
addresses, which decouple the globally-unique identifier from the device and
therefore make it more difficult to track a user device from its MAC/L2 address
<xref target="enhancing_location_privacy" />.
      </t>

      <t>
Note that there are reports <xref target="contact_tracing_paper" /> of some
mobile OSes reporting persistently (every 20 minutes or so) on MAC addresses
(among other information), which would defeat MAC address randomization. While
these practices might have changed by now, it is important to highlight that
privacy preserving techniques should be conducted considering all layers of the
protocol stack.
      </t>

    </section>


    <section anchor="sec:mac_addr_experiments" title="Privacy Workshop, Tutorial and Experiments at IETF and IEEE 802 meetings">

      <t>
As an outcome to the STRINT W3C/IAB Workshop <xref target="strint" />, on July
2014 a Tutorial on Pervasive Surveillance of the Internet - Designing Privacy
into Internet Protocols was given at the IEEE 802 Plenary meeting in San Diego
<xref target="privacy_tutorial" />. The Tutorial provided an update on the
recent developments regarding Internet privacy, the actions that other SDOs such
as IETF were taking, and guidelines that were being followed when developing new
Internet protocol specifications (e.g. <xref target="RFC6973" />). The Tutorial
highlighted some Privacy concerns applicable specifically to Link Layer
technologies and provided suggestions on how IEEE 802 could help addressing
them.
      </t>

      <t>
Following the discussions and interest within the IEEE 802 community, on 18 July
2014 the IEEE 802 Executive Committee (EC) created an IEEE 802 EC Privacy
Recommendation Study Group (SG) <xref target="ieee_privacy_ecsg" />. The work
and discussions from the group have generated multiple outcomes, such as: 802E
PAR: Recommended Practice for Privacy Considerations for IEEE 802 Technologies
<xref target="IEEE_802E" />, and the 802c PAR: Standard for Local and
Metropolitan Area Networks - Overview and Architecture Amendment - Local Medium
Access Control (MAC) Address Usage <xref target="IEEE_802c" />.
      </t>

      <t>
In order to test the effects of MAC address randomization, major trials were
conducted at the IETF and IEEE 802 meetings between November 2014 and March 2015
- IETF91, IETF92 and IEEE 802 Plenary in Berlin. The purpose of the experiments
was to evaluate the use of MAC address randomization from two different
perspectives: (i) the effect on the connectivity experience of the end-user,
also checking if applications and operating systems (OSs) were affected; and
(ii) the potential impact on the network infrastructure itself. Some of the
findings were published in <xref target="wifi_internet_privacy" />.
      </t>

      <t>
During the experiments it was observed that the probability of address
duplication in a network with this characteristics is negligible. The
experiments also showed that other protocol identifiers can be correlated and
therefore be used to still track an individual. Hence, effective privacy tools
should not work in isolation at a single layer, but they should be coordinated
with other privacy features at higher layers.
      </t>

      <t>
Since then, MAC randomization has further been implemented by mobile operating
systems to provide better privacy for mobile phone users when connecting to
public wireless networks <xref target="privacy_ios" />, <xref
target="privacy_windows" />, <xref target="privacy_android" />.

    <section anchor="sec:mac_rnd_at_ieee802" title="Recent RCM activities at the IEEE 802">

      <t>
Practical experiences of Randomized And Changing MAC Addresses (RCM) in live
devices helped researchers fine-tune their understanding of attacks against
randomization mechanisms <xref target="when_mac_randomization_fails" />. At IEEE
802.11 these research experiences eventually formed the basis for a specified
mechanism introduced in the IEEE 802.11aq in 2018 which randomize MAC addresses
that recommends mechanisms to avoid pitfalls <xref target="IEEE_802_11_aq" />.
      </t>

      <t>
More recent developments include turning on MAC randomization in mobile
operating systems by default, which has an impact on the ability of network
operators to personalize or customize services <xref
target="rcm_user_experience_csd" />. Therefore, follow-on work in the IEEE
802.11 mapped effects of potentially large uptake of randomized MAC identifiers
on a number of commonly offered operator services in 2019<xref
target="rcm_tig_final_report" />. In the summer of 2020 this work emanated in
two new standards projects with the purpose of developing mechanisms that do not
decrease user privacy and enable an optimal user experience when the MAC address
of a device in an Extended Service Set is randomized or changes <xref
target="rcm_user_experience_par" /> and user privacy solutions applicable to
IEEE Std 802.11 <xref target="rcm_privacy_par" />.
      </t>

      <t>
IEEE Std 802 <xref target="IEEE_802" />, as of the amendment IEEE 802c-2017
<xref target="IEEE_802c" />, specifies a local MAC address space structure known
as the Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP).The SLAP designates a range of
Extended Local Identifiers (ELIs) for subassignment within a block of addresses
assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority via a Company ID (CID). A range of
local MAC addresses is designated for Standard Assigned Identifiers (SAI) to be
specified by IEEE 802 standards. Another range of local MAC addresses is
designated for Administratively Assigned Identifiers (AAI) subject to assignment
by a network administrator.
      </t>

      <t>
IEEE Std 802E-2020: Recommended Practice for Privacy Considerations for IEEE 802
Technologies <xref target="IEEE_802E" /> recommends the use of temporary and
transient identifiers if there are no compelling reasons for a newly introduced
identifier to be permanent. This Recommended Practice is part of the basis for
the review of user privacy solutions for IEEE Std 802.11 (aka Wi-Fi) devices as
part of the RCM <xref target="rcm_privacy_csd" /> efforts. Annex T of IEEE Std
802.1AEdk-2023: MAC Privacy Protection <xref target="IEEE802.1AEdk-2023" />
discusses privacy considerations in bridged networks.

      <t>
<xref target="RFC4862" /> specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
for IPv6, which typically results in hosts configuring one or more "stable"
addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a local router, and an
Interface Identifier (IID). <xref target="RFC8064" /> formally updated the
original IPv6 IID selection mechanism to avoid generating the IID from the MAC
address of the interface (via EUI64), as this potentially allowed for global
tracking of a device at L3 from any point on the Internet (note that the prefix
part of the address provides meaningful insights of the physical location of the
device in general, which together with the MAC address-based IID, made it easier
to perform global device tracking).
      </t>

      <t>
<xref target="RFC8981" /> identifies and describes the privacy issues associated
with embedding MAC stable addressing information into the IPv6 addresses (as
part of the IID). It describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration that causes hosts to generate temporary addresses with
randomized interface identifiers for each prefix advertised with
autoconfiguration enabled. Changing addresses over time limits the window of
time during which eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially
perform address-based network-activity correlation when the same address is
employed for multiple transactions by the same host. Additionally, it reduces
the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes
revealed as a result of active communication. These temporary addresses are
meant to be used for a short period of time (hours to days) and would then be
deprecated. Deprecated addresses can continue to be used for already established
connections, but are not used to initiate new connections. New temporary
addresses are generated periodically to replace temporary addresses that expire.
In order to do so, a node produces a sequence of temporary global scope
addresses from a sequence of interface identifiers that appear to be random in
the sense that it is difficult for an outside observer to predict a future
address (or identifier) based on a current one, and it is difficult to determine
previous addresses (or identifiers) knowing only the present one. The main
problem with the temporary addresses is that they should not be used by
applications that listen for incoming connections (as these are supposed to be
waiting on permanent/well-known identifiers). Besides, if a node changes network
and comes back to a previously visited one, the temporary addresses that the
node would use will be different, and this might be an issue in certain networks
where addresses are used for operational purposes (e.g., filtering or
authentication). <xref target="RFC7217" />, summarized next, partially addresses
the problems aforementioned.
      </t>

      <t>
<xref target="RFC7217" /> describes a method to generate Interface Identifiers
that are stable for each network interface within each subnet, but that change
as a host moves from one network to another. This method enables keeping the
"stability" properties of the Interface Identifiers specified in <xref
target="RFC4291" />, while still mitigating address-scanning attacks and
preventing correlation of the activities of a host as it moves from one network
to another. The method defined to generate the IPv6 IID is based on computing a
hash function which takes as input information that is stable and associated to
the interface (e.g., a local interface identifier), stable information
associated to the visited network (e.g., IEEE 802.11 SSID), the IPv6 prefix, and
a secret key, plus some other additional information. This basically ensures
that a different IID is generated when any of the input fields changes (such as
the network or the prefix), but that the IID is the same within each subnet.
      </t>

      <t>
Currently, <xref target="RFC8064" /> recommends nodes to implement <xref
target="RFC7217" /> as the default scheme for generating stable IPv6 addresses
with SLAAC, to mitigate the privacy threats posed by the use of MAC-derived
IIDs.
      </t>

      <t>
In addition to the former documents, <xref target="RFC8947" />
proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer
address assignments where preassigned link-layer address assignments (such as by
a manufacturer) are not possible or unnecessary. <xref
target="RFC8948" /> proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols
to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP
quadrant to the server, so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the
quadrant requested by the relay or client.
      </t>

      <t>
Not only MAC and IP addresses can be used for tracking purposes. Some DHCP
options carry unique identifiers. These identifiers can enable device tracking
even if the device administrator takes care of randomizing other potential
identifications like link-layer addresses or IPv6 addresses. <xref
target="RFC7844" /> introduces anonymity profiles, designed for clients that
wish to remain anonymous to the visited network. The profiles provide guidelines
on the composition of DHCP or DHCPv6 messages, designed to minimize disclosure
of identifying information. <xref target="RFC7844" /> also indicates that the
link-layer address, IP address, and DHCP identifier shall evolve in synchrony.

          The vendor generates a unique 24-bit value for the lower 24-bits,
          forming the 48-bit MAC address.
          It has not been unusual for the 24-bit value to be taken as an
          incrementing counter, assigned at the factory, and burnt into
          non-volatile storage.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that 802.15.4 use 64-bit MAC addresses, and the IEEE assigns
          32-bit prefixes.
          The IEEE has indicated that there may be a future Ethernet
          specification using 64-bit MAC addresses.

      <section anchor="policy-pdgm" title="Per-Device Generated MAC address (PDGM)">

        <t>
          This form of MAC address is randomly generated by the device, usually upon first boot.
          The resulting MAC address is stored in non-volatile storage and is
          used for the rest of the device lifetime.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="policy-pbgm" title="Per-Boot Generated MAC address (PBGM)">

        <t>
          This form of MAC address is randomly generated by the device, each
          time the device is booted.

          The resulting MAC address is *not* stored in non-volatile storage.
          It does not persist across power cycles.

          This case may sometimes be a PDGM where the non-volatile storage is no longer functional
          (or has failed).
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="policy-pngm" title="Per-Network Generated MAC adress (PNGM)">

        <t>
          This form of MAC address is generated each time a new network
          connection is created.
        </t>
        <t>
          This is typically used with WiFi (802.11) networks where the network is identified by an SSID Name.
          The generated address is stored on non-volatile storage, indexed by the SSID.
          Each time the device returns to a network with the same SSID, the
          device uses the saved MAC address.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is possible to use PNGM for wired Ethernet connections through
          some passive observation of network traffic, such as STP, LLDP,
          DHCP or Router Advertisements to determine which network has been
          attached.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="policy-ppgm" title="Per-Period Generated MAC address (PPGM)">

        <t>
          This form of MAC address is generated periodically.
          Typical numbers are around every twelve hours.
          Like PNGM, it is used primarily with WiFi (802.11).
        </t>

        <t>
          When the MAC address changes, the station disconnects from the current
          session and reconnects using the new MAC address.
          This will involve a new WPA/802.1x session: new EAP, TLS, etc. negotiations.
          A new DHCP, Router-Advertisement will be done.
          TBD: it is unclear if any TLS session-resumption ticket (used by
          EAP-TLS) can or should be retained across a change of the MAC address.
        </t>
        <t>
          If DHCP is used, then a new DUID is generated so as to not link to
          the previous connection, and the result is usually new IP addresses
          allocated.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="policy-psgm" title="Per-Session Generated MAC address (PSGM)">

        <t>
          This form of MAC address is generated on a per session basis. Like PNGM, it is used primarily with WiFi (802.11).
        </t>

        <t>
          Since the address changes only when a new session is established, there is no disconnection/reconnection involved.

widely used OSes behave regarding MAC address randomization. <xref
target="tab:experiments-2021" /> summarizes our findings, where show on
different rows whether the OS performs address randomization per network, per
new connection, daily, supports configuration per SSID, supports address
randomization for scanning, and whether it does that by default.

According to <xref target="privacy_android"/>, starting in Android 12, Android
uses non-persistent randomization in the following situations: (i) a network
suggestion app specifies that non-persistant randomization be used for the
network (through an API); or (ii) the network is an open network that hasn't
encountered a captive portal and an internal config option is set to do so (by
default it is not).

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

      <t>
Privacy considerations regarding tracking the location of a user through the MAC
address of this device are discussed throughout this document. Given the
informational nature of this document, no protocols/solutions are specified, but
current state of affairs is documented.
      </t>
      
      <t>
Any future specification in this area would have to look into security and
privacy aspects, such as, but not limited to: i) mitigating the problem of
location privacy while minimizing the impact on upper layers of the protocol
stack; ii) providing means to network operators to authenticate devices and
authorize network access despite the MAC addresses changing following some
pattern; and, iii) provide means for the device not to use MAC addresses it is
not authorized to use or that are currently in use.
      </t>
      
      <t>
A major conclusion of the work in IEEE Std 802E concerned the difficulty of
defending privacy against adversaries of any sophistication. In particular it
has been shown that individuals can be successfully tracked by fingerprinting
using aspects of their communication other than MAC Addresses or other permanent
identifiers. Machine learning techniques facilitate fingerprinting without the
adversary needing to understand the technical reasons for the correlation.
